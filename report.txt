For my scheduling algorithm I implemented a "shortest job first" (SJF) approach. The algorithm works
by preferencing the process with the shortest runtime in the queue. This allows an improvement
in turnaround time and time overhead as the average time processes spend waiting to be run is
reduced. Comparing it to the baselines,  One issue that could occur with SJF is having a process 
with a long run-time having to wait if shorter processes are continually added.







(1) its short description; 
(2) scenarios where it performs better than the baselines and why; 
(3) scenarios where it does not perform well and why (if applicable).
